KNOWN ISSUES / NOTES / TODO

    - We may have to switch compilers, for some reason TCC isn't
      checking basic things like sending the correct parameter to 
      functions...
    - Attack
    - Fetching the user's characters isn't working properly
      Any user can see any characters.
    - Redirect the output from stdout to a file, so we can see
      what went wrong if the server crashes (or for some reason,
      the terminal gets closed)
